# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We intend to keep supporting latest version with support for all minor versions in the semantic versioning `X.Y.Z`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "[Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare/security)" tab.

Here is what to expect after the security concerned is raised. A Root cause analysis is conducted, if it is indeed a security vulnerability, comprising of following steps:
- Original vulnerability source and how to replicate it if possible.
- OWASP assessment and suggestions including alternatives
- Patch to fix the vulnerability through PR
- An Architectural Decision Record is created under `/docs/NNN-ARD.md`
